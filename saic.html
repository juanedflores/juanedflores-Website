                The installation involved two projects. On the main wall there
                are acrylic paintings that sync up to an 11 minute video on
                loop. In the entrance, there are two life sized figures trapped
                in chain link frames. The clinking sounds from their struggle to
                get out fill the gallery space. All cinematography, sound
                recording, prop and installation building, paintings, were made
                by Juan Flores. The installation features classmates as actors
                traversing the wall, and dancers improvising and interpreting a
                trapped figure.

                First two minutes of video is enough to watch. This installation
                was made in collaboration with sound artist Isaac Medina (Mexico
                City, Mexico) under the alias of our collective PHAGES. My role
                was in creating a program written in Java that uses image
                processing algorithms to deconstruct images taken from screen
                captures of social media with a particular set of hashtags from
                the arts festival. The program also had projection mapping
                features with OSC communication between a Pure Data patch that
                uses granular synthesis made by Isaac. The title alludes to an
                imagined life after Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Google, and
                Facebook. Documentation of installation was made by Isaac
                Medina.

                A minute of viewing is enough to watch. This is another
                iteration of Post-Data and gives a good idea of how the Java
                written program worked. Blobs based on color similarity and size
                are detected in a screen capture of videos online taken in real
                time. These blobs are placed in a particular display style on a
                canvas. The sound featured is the work of Mexican City based
                artist Isaac Medina, who uses a Pure Data patch that takes the
                real time audio and processes it using granular synthesis.

                The three panels are each their own sound composition. They all
                have circuit bent electronics that come from toys that resembled
                musical instruments. Each sound loop is turned on and off
                programmatically using relays and a Raspberry Pi.

      <h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My first hands-on experiences were at 15 helping create murals around
        San Antonio, TX. The concepts behind them were almost always inspired by
        the area they were installed in, looking at the Mexican-American
        culture, along with its history and significant contributions. This has
        always stuck with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an undergrad at Connecticut College, aware of being a minority for
        the first time, I started to become familiar with the feeling of
        duality. This feeling grew stronger during my many yearly visits to the
        border towns of Del Rio, TX, where I was born, and Ciudad Acuña, Mexico,
        where my family is from including both my parents. One summer, I did an
        assistantship with installation artist Adriana Corral, whose work
        attracted me for its handling of the border as a topic, as well as
        addressing erased histories of injustice and violence. I gained research
        skills by digging into the archives, and I learned the importance of
        collecting the physical materials of the site, even those under one's
        nose such as soil and discarded objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by our many conversations, I studied abroad in Berlin, Germany,
        where I wanted to investigate the Berlin Wall as another example of a
        separation barrier. During this time, striking images of refugees
        started appearing from the European migrant crisis of 2015. I remember
        being in disbelief of how these harsh realities can look so theatrical,
        especially in Melilla and Ceuta, spanish cities bordering Morocco, where
        migrants charged in bulk to climb the border fence. That summer, I
        worked at Daniel Canogar's studio in Madrid, Spain. His video
        installations had inspired me the year before when I saw his
        <i>Small Data</i> series at Bitforms Gallery during a trip to NYC. I was
        interested in how he used projections to interact with real objects and
        cross thresholds. Working there gave me the technical confidence to
        create my own installation the following year that solidified themes
        that I continue to explore today.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my installation, I built tall chain link fences to represent the
        in-between spaces that one experiences in travel, crossings, relocation,
        and displacement between two worlds, lives, or bodies. After seeing
        refugees hang their laundry on these fences, and seeing the tattered and
        bloodied clothes left behind by those who attempted to climb the spiked
        metallic structures, clothing became something that represented struggle
        and lost and forgotten lives. Unknowingly at first, the process of
        making it was a sort of private and personal cathartic performance. In
        the construction of the props used for climbing and shooting, I was
        frequently seen wearing my father's construction foreman vest and
        hardhat, reflecting on his immigrant journey and presence as an
        electrician. This realization inspired me to document it and create a
        separate set of pieces using a telephone pole as another climbable
        object, built to resemble a cross, alluding to my catholic upbringing.
        Using the Stations of the Cross narrative, the border became to mean a
        zone of death and rebirth, keeping in mind that I was the new life and
        continuation of my immigrant parent's work.

        The performance bug grew in Mexico City, where I stayed for a year and a
        half thanks to a travelling fellowship to focus on sound and researching
        indigenous instruments. Though experimental, I continued to use found
        objects such as recycled electronics while exploring Post-Humanism.
        While there, I performed with a local sound artist who is still my
        biggest collaborator to this day. Working under our moniker PHAGES, we
        continue to present programming intensive audiovisual work in arts
        festivals that explore digital spaces.
      </p>

        At SAIC, I would like to continue to work with the moving image in
        relation to 3D objects and public spaces, with an interest in tying in
        physical computing and the web to add interactivity. Getting to work
        with faculty like Nick Briz and Lee Blalock would be well aligned to
        pick up the work I have been doing recently, as well as using the
        resources offered like the Electronics Lab and The Black Box would be
        indispensable for experimentation. Since San Antonio is behind in art
        with coding, one of my goals is to establish a space that exhibits and
        teaches cheap and accessible ways to create new-media art.
