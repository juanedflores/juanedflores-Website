**1K Resistor + 1uF Capacitor**  
Vpp (Voltage Peak to Peak) = 7.12 - 7.52V  
Vmax = 8V  
Freq = 1.19kHz  

# Oscilloscope Basics
What is an Oscilloscope?
To visualize an electrical signal.
Dynamically graphing voltage over time.

# Summing Oscillatos Together
You need an op amp circuit.

#Â Hysterisis Voltage
A Schmitt trigger will be designed to have positive threshold voltage (Vt+) to be higher than negative threshold voltage (Vt-).

For example, for a 74LS14
Vt+ = 1.6V
Vt- = 0.8V

The hysteresis voltage is the difference = 0.8V.
