	•	About This Blog I created this blog in 2021 to keep track of the step by step processes of things I learned and projects I made. It has a focus in Art & Technology. While it started as a reference for my future self, I try to write in a way that may be accessible for someone to follow along and who is interested in the same topics.  A more detailed explanation of the functionality of this blog is documented in the 'More About This Blog' post.
