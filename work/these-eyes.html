    <strong>These-Eyes</strong> is a live coding performance with an interactive
    component from the viewers. A website is setup on Heroku to grab an image
    from https://thispersondoesnotexist.com periodically and scan it for eyes
    using OpenCV. These eyes are then constructed in a collage and presented on
    the top of the site and dynamically updated. Optionally, the public can
    submit their own detected eyes by turning on their webcam. This grid of eyes
    will be our visual material to be manipulated by us in real time using the
    live coding environment Hydra (https://github.com/ojack/hydra), while at the
    same time generating related bodily and electronic sounds using Tidalcycles
    (https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome).
